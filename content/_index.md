Hi! I'm a predoctoral researcher in philosophy at the Ruhr University Bochum.

My research focus is on **philosophy of AI**, including questions such as: What is it for an AI to deceive? And how can we ascribe beliefs, desires, or intentions to AI? I also conduct more technical research on detection and mitigation approaches of LLM deception rooted in **mechanistic interpretability**.

I am supervized by [Albert Newen](https://www.pe.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/philosophie/ii/newen/newen/index.html.de) and [Christian Straßer](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/rrs-philosophy/c/christian.html). My dissertation will be on the topic: *"Deception by Large Language Models: A Mechanistic Perspective Grounded in the Philosophy of Artificial Minds"*.
